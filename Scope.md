# Scope

Whenever you learn a programming language, one
of the very first questions you should have is "tell me about the scope".
What does this mean? 
Generally, it is where does the language find variables that you use in your 
commands.
For example, if we have the R command 
```r
d = data.frame(a = x, b = y)
```
what does this actually mean?  Let's consider this as a sentence and understand what the "nouns"
refer to.
