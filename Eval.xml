<para>
The purpose of this is to coalesce some of the material we discussed in the first two days (Feb/March 2020),
focusing primarily on how <r/> finds variables when evaluating functions.
And environments are key to this.
An environment is a just a container for variables,
that is names bound to values/<r/> objects.
And each environment has a parent-environment and so an environment
is part of list/chain of environments.
When we look for a variable, we look along this list of environments.
The nature of environments is the same throughout <r/>,
but which chain of environments we search differs slightly
by whether we are evaluating code in the body of a function in a package
or at the top-level prompt or related to a (model) formula.
</para>


<section>
<title>Calling a Function in a Package</title>
<para>
Consider the call  
<r:code>
scatter.smooth(mtcars[, c("mpg", "wt")], , .75, xlab = "Weight", yla = "Miles per gallon",
                  main = "Motor Trend Cars Data")
</r:code>
issued at the <r/> prompt.
<r/> parses this and we have the language object that is a
<r:class>call</r:class> to <r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func>.
So <r/> has to find that function.
Since this is being evaluated at the prompt, <r/> looks in the global
environment and its chain of parent environments.
We can use <r:func>find</r:func> to see where this is located:
<r:code>
find("scatter.smooth")
<r:output><![CDATA[
[1] "package:stats"
]]></r:output>
</r:code>
This is on the search path as we can see with
<r:code>
search()
<r:output><![CDATA[
[1] ".GlobalEnv"        "package:stats"     "package:graphics" 
[4] "package:grDevices" "package:datasets"  "package:utils"    
[7] "package:methods"   "Autoloads"         "package:base"     
]]></r:output>
</r:code>
So <r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func> is in the second element of the search path,
package:stats.
</para>


<para>
  While we can use <r:func>search</r:func> to locate the function,
  let's introduce a function <r:func>getEnvChain</r:func>   in
  <ulink url="showEnv.R"><filename>showEnv.R</filename></ulink>
  that shows the chain of environments generally, not just the search path.
<r:code>
source("showEnv.R")
names(getEnvChain(globalenv()))
<r:output><![CDATA[
 [1] "globalenv"         "package:stats"     "package:graphics" 
 [4] "package:grDevices" "package:datasets"  "package:utils"    
 [7] "package:methods"   "Autoloads"         "<base>"           
[10] "emptyenv"         
]]></r:output>
</r:code>  
We've included the empty environment at the end.
We'll use this for more interesting cases than the global environment.
</para>

<para>
 Having found the function <r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func> function,
 <r/> prepares to call it.
<ol> 
<li> <r/> creates a call frame which is an environment.</li>
<li> creates a variable in the call frame for each of the parameters/formal arguments in the
definition of the function, i.e., <r:expr>names(formals(scatter.smooth))</r:expr></li>
<li> matches the arguments in the call to the parameters in the function definition
<ol>
  <li> matching named arguments by that correspond exactly to names of parameters</li>
  <li> matching remaining named arguments by partial name matching, except to
     parameters  after <r:dots/> in the function definition</li>
  <li> matching the remaining arguments by position to the remaining parameters.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
To see how <r/> matches arguments in a particular call, we can use
<r:func>match.call</r:func>.
<r:code>
match.call(scatter.smooth,
           quote(scatter.smooth(mtcars[, c("mpg", "wt")], , .75,
                                xlab = "Weight", yla = "Miles per gallon",
                                main = "Motor Trend Cars Data")))
<r:output><![CDATA[
scatter.smooth(x = mtcars[, c("mpg", "wt")], xlab = "Weight", 
    ylab = "Miles per gallon", main = "Motor Trend Cars Data")
]]></r:output>
</r:code>
</para>

<para>
<r/> doesn't evaluate any of the arguments in the call at this point due to
<i>lazy evaluation</i>. The value of each variable in the call
frame at this point is a <i>promise</i>. This is the code corresponding
to that argument in the call, along with the environment in which that code needs
to be evaluated.  When the function first asks for the value of the variable in the call
frame, that will trigger <r/> to evaluate the promise and that is when the argument will be
actually evaluated.  And it will be evaluated in the environment in which the function
(<r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func>)
was called. In our case, this is the global environment since we call <r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func>
from the <r/> prompt.
</para>


<para>
  Now with the call frame constructed and the arguments matched to parameters,
  <r/> is ready to evaluate the body of the function being called, <r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func>.
  We can see the expressions in the body of the function with
  <r:code>
body(scatter.smooth)
<r:output><![CDATA[
{
    xlabel <- if (!missing(x)) 
        deparse(substitute(x))
    ylabel <- if (!missing(y)) 
        deparse(substitute(y))
    xy <- xy.coords(x, y, xlabel, ylabel)
    x <- xy$x
    y <- xy$y
    xlab <- if (is.null(xlab)) 
        xy$xlab
    else xlab
    ylab <- if (is.null(ylab)) 
        xy$ylab
    else ylab
    pred <- loess.smooth(x, y, span, degree, family, evaluation)
    plot(x, y, ylim = ylim, xlab = xlab, ylab = ylab, ...)
    do.call(lines, c(list(pred), lpars))
    invisible()
}
]]></r:output>
  </r:code>
  <r/> now loops over these expressions and  uses
  the call frame as the environment in which to evaluate each expression.
  <r:func>missing</r:func> and <r:func>substitute</r:func>
  are two functions that use non-standard evaluation. So let's ignore these
  for now. Just know that <r:func>missing</r:func> is used
  to determine if that parameter (e.g. <r:arg>x</r:arg>) was explicitly
  provided a value in this call to the <r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func>;
  and, in this use of <r:func>substitute</r:func>, it returns the <r/> code corresponding to the
  specified parameter (e.g., by looking inside the promise).
</para>

<para>
So let's consider the third expression
<r:code><![CDATA[
xy <- xy.coords(x, y, xlabel, ylabel)
]]></r:code>  
This is an assignment. Since it is evaluated in the call frame,
the assignment will be in this call frame (an environment).
There is no parameter named <r:var>xy</r:var>, so this will create
a new variable in the call frame named <r:var>xy</r:var>,
if evaluating the right-hand side succeeds and does not throw an error.
<r/> evaluates the righ-hand side of the assignment before trying to make the
assignment. So it evaluates
<r:code>
xy.coords(x, y, xlabel, ylabel)
</r:code>
This is a function call, so <r/> first looks for <r:var>xy.coords</r:var>.
It looks first in the current environment, the call frame for our call to <r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func>.
It is not there. So it looks in the parent environment, just it did when looking for
<r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func>. But what is the parent environment of the call frame for
our call to <r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func>.
While I could tell you, let's actually find it.
We'll debug the call to <r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func>
and then get the call frame and ask for its <r:func>parent.env</r:func>
<r:code>
debug(scatter.smooth)
scatter.smooth(mtcars[, c(1, 2)])
</r:code>
At the Browse prompt, we can get the call frame with
<r:code>
environment()
<r:output><![CDATA[
<environment: 0x7fd23971cda0>
]]></r:output>  
</r:code>
The display is a hexadecimal number. It represents the location in memory of the call frame.
It will be different on your machine. The important thing to know is that it is not a named
environment such as R_GlobalEnv or package:stats, or package:base. It is an <i>ad hoc</i>,
short-lived environment.
</para>

<para>
We can list the names of the variables in this environment/call frame with
<r:code>
ls(environment(), all = TRUE)
<r:output><![CDATA[
 [1] "..."        "degree"     "evaluation" "family"     "lpars"     
 [6] "span"       "x"          "xlab"       "y"          "ylab"      
[11] "ylim"      
]]></r:output>  
</r:code>  
We can manually see that these are the same names as those of the parameters
for <r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func>. We can also verify this programmatically
with
<r:code>
setdiff(names(formals()), ls(environment(), all = TRUE))
</r:code>
and this returns the empty character vector.
We could also get the call frame with
<r:code>
sys.frames()[[1]]
</r:code>
in this specific case, but this is more complex in more nested calls.
So note that <r:expr>environment()</r:expr> and <r:func>formals</r:func>
know which call frame and function being called they are currently working on.
</para>

<para>
So now that we have the call frame, let's look along its chain of environments
to find <r:var>xy.coords</r:var>.
We can use our <r:func>showEnv</r:func> function to show the chain of environments
<r:code>
names(getEnvChain(environment()))
<r:output><![CDATA[
 [1] "<0x7fd23971d3c0>"  "<namespace:stats>" "imports:stats"    
 [4] "<namespace:base>"  "globalenv"         "package:stats"    
 [7] "package:graphics"  "package:grDevices" "package:datasets" 
[10] "package:utils"     "package:methods"   "Autoloads"        
[13] "<base>"            "emptyenv"         
]]></r:output>
</r:code>
We can use <r:func>efind</r:func>, a variant of <r:func>find</r:func> we wrote for this exposition,
to find which of these environments in the chain contain a variable with a given name
<r:code>
z = efind("xy.coords", environment(), FALSE)
<r:output><![CDATA[
[1] "imports:stats"     "package:grDevices"
]]></r:output>
</r:code>
If we look in each of these environments for <r:var>xy.coords</r:var>,
we'll find exactly the same function (as the <r:pkg>stats</r:pkg>
package imports the <r:pkg>grDevices</r:pkg> packages):
<r:code>
a = lapply(z, function(e) e$xy.coords)
identical(a[[1]], a[[2]])
</r:code>
</para>

<para>
So now we have found the <r:func>xy.coords</r:func> function.
With this,  <r/> starts the same preparation for the call to this function
by creating a call frame, creating variables within it for each of the
parameters in the definition of the function, and then matching
the arguments in the call.
Again, we can use <r:func>match.call</r:func> to see how the call
matches the arguments to the parameters:
<r:code>
match.call(xy.coords, quote(xy.coords(x, y, xlabel, ylabel)))
<r:output><![CDATA[
xy.coords(x = x, y = y, xlab = xlabel, ylab = ylabel)
]]></r:output>
</r:code>
So the parameter <r:arg>x</r:arg> in the call frame for
<r:func>xy.coords</r:func> is assigned (bound to) a promise
to compute the expression <r:expr>x</r:expr>
which will be evaluated in the environment
in which we called <r:func>xy.coords</r:func> and this is the call frame of our call to
<r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func>.
</para>


<para>
Note that because of the non-standard evaluation of
<r:code><![CDATA[
    xlabel <- if (!missing(x)) 
        deparse(substitute(x))
    ylabel <- if (!missing(y)) 
        deparse(substitute(y))
]]></r:code>  
we have yet to actually use the values of <r:var>x</r:var> and <r:var>y</r:var>.
So <r/> has not evaluated the values of these parameters due to lazy evaluation.
Specifically, we have not evaluated, for example, the command <r:expr>mtcars[, c("mpg", "cyl")]</r:expr>.
This will happen soon when the value is actually needed. And we will see this later in the call
stack, i.e., the sequence of calls from one function to another, to another.
</para>

<para>
  We can arrange to stop in the call to <r:func>xy.coords</r:func>
  via <r:expr>debug(xy.coords)</r:expr>.
  (BTW, to stop debugging each call to <r:func>xy.coords</r:func>,
  we use <r:expr>undebug(xy.coords)</r:expr>. That is we use
  <r:func>undebug</r:func> as the opposite of <r:func>debug</r:func>.)
  Now we continue evaluating the next expression in the
  body of <r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func> via stepping in the debugger.
  This calls <r:func>xy.coords</r:func> and we stop at the start of
  that function call.
  Note that if we call <r:func>substitute(x)</r:func> here
  it won't give us the code <r:expr>mtcars[, c("mpg", "wt")]</r:expr>
  from the call to <r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func>.
  Instead, it gives us simply <r:expr>x</r:expr>.
  This is because the parameter <r:arg>x</r:arg> in the call
  to <r:func>xy.coords</r:func> (from within <r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func>)
  was specified in the call to <r:func>xy.coords</r:func> as simply
  <r:expr>x</r:expr>, i.e., <r:expr>xy.coords(x, y, xlabel, ylabel)</r:expr>.
  So the code for the argument is <r:expr>x</r:expr>.
  When we evaluate that promise, it is the value of <r:var>x</r:var>
  in the call frame of <r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func>.
  And that is the promise with the code <r:expr>mtcars[, c("mpg", "wt")]</r:expr>
  which will be evaluated in the global environment
  since that is where we made the call to <r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func>.
</para>

<para>
  Since we know we are interested in when
  the call to <r:op>[</r:op> on <r:func>mtcars</r:func>
  happens, we'll debug the <r:op>[</r:op> function.
  We can't use
<r:code>
debug([)
</r:code>  
as that is a syntax error - <r/> is looking for a closing ].
So we refer to the symbol [ with `[`, i.e.,
<r:code>
debug(`[`)
</r:code>
</para>

<para>
  Since <r:var>y</r:var>   is <r:null/>
  in <r:func>xy.coords</r:func>,
  we evaluate the body of the <r:func>if</r:func>
  statement <r:expr>if(is.null(y))</r:expr>.
  The second expression in this is
  <r:expr>if(is.language(x))...</r:expr>
  This uses the value of <r:arg>x</r:arg>
  so <r/> needs to evaluate the promise
  for that parameter value.
  This is when <r:op>[</r:op> gets called
  in the <r:expr>mtcars[, c("mpg", "wt")]</r:expr>.
  So we step through this code in the debugger
  and stop in the function <r:func>[.data.frame</r:func>.
  We can inspect the call stack from within the debugger
  using the debugger command <r:var>where</r:var>:
<r:code>
where
<r:output><![CDATA[
where 1 at #1: `[.data.frame`(mtcars, , c("mpg", "wt"))
where 2 at #1: mtcars[, c("mpg", "wt")]
where 3: xy.coords(x, y, xlabel, ylabel)
where 4: scatter.smooth({
    cat("evaluating now\n")
    mtcars[, c("mpg", "wt")]
})  
]]></r:output>  
</r:code>  
We can also use <r:func>sys.calls()</r:func>
to see the call stack, and this works when we are not in the debugger:
<r:code>
  sys.calls()
<r:output><![CDATA[
[[1]]
scatter.smooth({
    cat("evaluating now\n")
    mtcars[, c("mpg", "wt")]
})

[[2]]
xy.coords(x, y, xlabel, ylabel)

[[3]]
mtcars[, c("mpg","wt")]

[[4]]
mtcars[, c("mpg","wt")]
]]></r:output>  
</r:code>
Note that a) this returns a list of language objects, and b)
these are in the reverse order as shown by the debugger's <r:var>where</r:var>.
</para>


<para>
  Why did we get to <r:func>[.data.frame</r:func>
  and not <r:op>[</r:op>?
  And why does <r:func>sys.calls</r:func> have
  two identical elements <r:expr>mtcars[, c("mpg","wt")]</r:expr>?
  The reason is the same for both questions
  and relates to <r/>'s object oriented <s3/> method dispatch.
  We called <r:op>[</r:op> and that looked for a method based on the cllass
  of its first argument, <r:var>mtcars</r:var>,  which is a <r:class>data.frame</r:class>.  So <r/> passed the call to
  to <r:op>[</r:op> to the more specific version <r:func>[.data.frame</r:func>.
  We'll talk about this later.
</para>

<para>
The expression <r:expr>mtcars[, c("mpg", "wt")]</r:expr>
is interesting. Firstly, it is actually a call to <r:op>[</r:op>.
We can see this via
<r:code>
sys.call()
<r:output><![CDATA[
mtcars[, c("mpg","wt")]
]]></r:output>
</r:code>
when we are debugging in the call frame for <r:func>[.data.frame</r:func>.
Specifically,
<r:code>
sys.call()[[1]]
</r:code>
returns <r:var>[.data.frame</r:var>.
The first argument is <r:var>mtcars</r:var>.
The second, corresponding to the rows to subset,  is missing/not specified.
The third is the function call <r:expr>c("mpg", "wt")</r:expr>.
We can ask is the second argument missing with
<r:code>
missing(i)
</r:code>
and we get <r:true/>.
</para>


<para>
  This has shown us that <r:expr>mtcars[, c("mpg", "wt")]</r:expr> is not
  evaluated until we are in the body of <r:func>xy.coords</r:func>
  called from <r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func>.
  So we have witnessed and verified lazy evaluation via the call stack.
</para>


<figure>
  <title>Call Stack, Call Frames and their Environment Chains/Search Paths</title>
<graphic fileref="callStackSearchPathFig.png" format="png"/>
<caption>
<p>This shows the call stack for <r:expr>scatter.smooth(mtcars[, c(1, 2)])</r:expr>.
<r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func> calls <r:func>xy.coords</r:func> and finally the argument for <r:arg>x</r:arg> in 
<r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func> is needed.
Due to <r/>'s lazy evaluation, this is evaluated next,
hence the call the <r:expr>[(mtcars, c(1, 2))</r:expr>.
Within each of the three call frames, 
<r/> searches for symbols by looking first in the 
call frame and then in its parent environment, and its parent environment,
and so on.
These  environments are displayed moving from left to right and show
the search through packages and their imports and their parents.

<!--
<para>
As we step through the code in the body <r:func>xy.coords</r:func>
we get to
<r:code><![CDATA[
x <- data.matrix(x)
]]></r:code>  
Again, we find <r:func>data.matrix</r:func>:
<r:code>
efind("data.matrix", environment())
<r:output><
![CDATA[
[1] "<namespace:base>" "<base>"          
]]></r:output>
</r:code>
We create the call frame and match the sole argument.
The parameter names for <r:func>data.matrix</r:func>
are <r:arg>frame</r:arg> and <r:arg>rownames.force</r:arg>.
So the value <r:expr>x</r:expr> is matched to <r:arg>frame</r:arg>.
</para>
<para>
Again, we don't evaluate <r:expr>x</r:expr> but create a promise.
And this still maps back to <r:expr>mtcars[, c("mpg", "wt")]</r:expr>
in the call to <r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func>.
But that promise has already been evaluated within <r:func>xy.coords</r:func>.
We can  debug <r:func>data.matrix</r:func>
and step through to that call.
When we enter that function, we can look at the call stack with
the debugging command <r:expr>where</r:expr> which shows
<r:code>
Browse[4]> where
<r:output><![CDATA[

The first   expression in the body of the

<section>
<title>Environment of a Function Defined Inside a Function</title>

<para>
We just looked at a call to <r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func>
which is a function defined in a package.
We saw how it found the functions it itself called (e.g. <r:func>xy.coords</r:func>)
along its own search path, not the <r/> session search path.
We found this chain of environments from within the call frame
in our call to <r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func>.
We could have also obtained the environment of the <r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func>
function with
<r:code>
environment(scatter.smooth)
<r:output><![CDATA[
<environment: namespace:stats>
]]></r:output>
</r:code>
A namespace is a specific type of environment
and relates to packages.
This is the parent environment of the call frame
in our call to <r:func>scatter.smooth</r:func>.
And this generality is true for all call frames -
the parent environment of a call frame
is the environment of the function (definition)
being called.
And what is the environment of a function?
<i>The environment of a function is the
environment in which that function is defined.</i>
What does this mean?
<ol>
  <li>If the function is defined in a package,
  the environment is the namespace of that package.
  </li>
  <li>
If a function is defined at the <r/> prompt,
the environment is the global environment
since that is where the creation of the function is evaluated.
  </li>
  <li>
If the function is defined via calling <r:func>source</r:func>,
the environment is the one used in that call to the <r:func>source</r:func> function
and, when called from the <r/> prompt, that defaults to the global environment.
However, we can specify the environment in which <r:func>source</r:func>
should evaluate the expressions.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a function is defined within the body of a function,
    then its environment is the call frame of in which it is defined.
    This gives us closures.
  </li>
</ol>
</para>


<para>
  Let's define a simple function at the <r/> prompt.
<r:code>
f = function(n) median(rnorm(n))
</r:code>  
What is its environment?
<r:code>
environment(f)
<r:output><![CDATA[
<environment: R_GlobalEnv>
]]></r:output>
</r:code>
When we call <r:func>f</r:func>, <r/> will
create a call frame and match the argument to the parameter
and evaluate the expressions in the body.
It will look for <r:func>rnorm</r:func>
in the call frame and then in the parent environment and so on.
The parent environment of the call frame will
be <r:expr>environment(f)</r:expr>, that is the global environment
as we just determined.
</para>


<para>
  Let's write another function, again at the top-level <r/> prompt.
  This one defines and returns a function
<r:code>
gen = function(n) {
         function(mu) rnorm(n, mu)
} 
</r:code>
This function has one parameter <r:arg>n</r:arg>.
It returns a function which itself has only parameter
<r:arg>mu</r:arg>.
We can call <r:func>gen</r:func> with an integer
giving the sample size
<r:code>
f1 = gen(10)
</r:code>
<r:var>f1</r:var> is now a function
<r:output><![CDATA[
function(mu) rnorm(n, mu)
<environment: 0x7fd24a150308>
]]></r:output>
Note the environment displayed.
We won't see this on our function <r:func>gen</r:func>
when we print it. That is because it is the global environment
and <r/> doesn't show that environment when display a function.
But we see an environment on all other functions, e.g.,
<r:func>scatter.smoooth</r:func> shows
<r:output><![CDATA[
<environment: namespace:stats>
]]></r:output>
</para>
<para>
  In the case of <r:var>f</r:var>,
  the environment is the call frame for our call to <r:expr>gen(10)</r:expr>
  in which the function was created.
  Let's debug another call to <r:func>gen</r:func>
<r:code>
debug(gen)
f2 = gen(13)
</r:code>
Let's get the identifier for the call frame with
<r:code>
environment()
<r:output><![CDATA[
<environment: 0x7fd2598ede10>
]]></r:output>
</r:code>
(This will be a different hexadecimal value  in your <r/> session.)
Now we'll continue the evaluation of the function call and return.
What is the environment of <r:var>f2</r:var>?
<r:code>
environment(f2)
<r:output><![CDATA[
<environment: 0x7fd2598ede10>
]]></r:output>
</r:code>
It is the call frame in which the function object was defined.
</para>
<para>
  What are the variables in that environment?
<r:code>
ls(environment(f2), all = TRUE)
<r:output><![CDATA[
[1] "n"
]]></r:output>
</r:code>
What is the value of that <r:var>n</r:var>?
<r:code>
environment(f2)$n  
<r:output><![CDATA[
[1] 13
]]></r:output>
</r:code>
i.e.,  the value of <r:var>n</r:var> in our call to <r:func>gen</r:func>
that created the function we assigned to <r:var>f2</r:var>.
</para>
<para>
  What's the value of n in the environment of <r:var>f1</r:var> ?
  That is 10 since we created <r:var>f1</r:var>
  with the call <r:expr>f1 = gen(10)</r:expr>.
</para>
