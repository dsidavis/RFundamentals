# Brief Recap

+ REPL
+ syntax errors versus run-time/evaluation errors.
+ literal values
+ lookup of symbols
  + name  - `pi`
  + name of function in call - `sum()`
+ function calls
  + matching arguments to parameters
    + full name
    + partial name
    + position, for remaining parameters
+ "scope" - finding symbols in body of function
+ lazy evaluation

---

# Use RStudio. It is more common.

+ Totally understand.
--

+ And also, totally the point of the "Fundamentals".

--

+ Abstract concepts away from a point-and-click interface.

+ Focus on the language concepts, not the way it is presented to us.

--

+ Understand the many ways to communicate with R.
    + e.g., Rscript, littleR, Shiny, ...

---

# More powerpoint

--
+ Can be useful
+ Can significantly alter the way we hear and think
   + Negatively
---

# Recap

[Call Stack & Search Path](callStackSearchPath.pdf)

---
# Non-standard Evaluation

+ `library(stats)`
--
   + library("stats")

--

+ rm(a, b)

--
   + rm(list = c("a", "b"))
   + Note that rm(li = c("a", "b")) won't work.
      + ... is first parameter, so partial name matching doesn't match `list`.

--
+ quote(), substitute()
```
f = function(x)
{
    e = substitute(x)
    plot(x, ylab = deparse(e))
}
```
---
# Scope: Where are variables found.
## Question 1

+ What are the similarities and difference between these three implementations
  of essentially the same thing:

```
lapply(x, function(x)
            identical(x, target))
```

```
check = function(x)
           identical(x, target)
lapply(x, check)
```

```
lapply(x, function(x, a)
            identical(x, a),
          target)
```

--
+ Where is `target` found?

---

# Question 2

```
do = 
function(x, y)
{
  med = median(y)
  lapply(x, function(x) {
               x = x[!is.na(x)]
               x > med
            })
}
```

+ Where/how is med found?

---

```
f = function() i <<- 1
f()
```
Where is `i`?

---

```
f = function(j) j <<- j + 1
f()
```
Where's `j` ?


---
# Computing the Likelihood 

+ Doing this explicitly for emphasis
   + See "natural" way next.
   + [See Closures.md](Closures.md)

--

```
lik = function(mu, sd)
         dnorm(x, mu, sd)
lik
```
+ Where's x?

--

```
e = new.env()
e$x = rnorm(100, .5, 1)
environment(lik) = e
lik
```
+ Note the environment.

```
ls(environment(lik))
```
---

# Closures - "natural" way.

```

```

---
# Defining functions inside functions


+ Avoid
  + Can't reuse them outside of the host function.
  + Can't test them separately from the host function.
+ Use if updating non-local variable across calls
   +  possibly shared with other functions defined in same scope.
+ Does make them invisible to other functions and users 
   + so less clutter
   + but can do that via a package and not exporting the helper/inside function.

---

# Formulae

```
f = mpg ~ cyl
```

```
str(f)
```

---
```
a = runif(10)
b = 5 + 2.34*a + rnorm(length(a))
lm(b ~ a)
```

```
f = function(x, y)   y ~ x
```

```
frm = f(a, b)
y ~ x
<environment: 0x7fa27c966da8>
lm(frm)
```
